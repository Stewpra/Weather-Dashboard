# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

There are many easy ways to get the weather now adays. This project was a fantastic exercise in the use of third party apis. The main goal was to be more comfortable with the regular use of these apis.

## Usage

When reaching the site the user will be left with a pretty blank page with one input field and submit button. After searching their first city the user will see the current weather for the given city that day as well as a 5 day forcast. Their is enough information to get a complete picture of what the overall conditions of the given days will be. The city name will also appear on a button in the search history area. Clicking on any of the buttons will allow the user to display the information for that given city again.
